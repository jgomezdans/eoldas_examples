===============

The first example (in http://www2.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~plewis/eoldas/eoldas_guide.html) runs a Savitzky-Golay filter over some MODIS NDVI data. The script is ``savitzy_golay.py``, and it requires the file ``data/FuentesAndalucia_MOD09A1.txt`` that holds the data. You run the script by issuing the command ``python savitzky_golay.py``. This will pop a window, that when closed will save the plot to the images directory (this directory will be created if it doesn't exist).
