The first experiment from
http://www2.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~plewis/eoldas/eoldas_guide.html

is to run the script ``python savitzky_golay.py``, which will read up a file
from the data directory (FuentesDe*.txt), will pop up a graphic window, and
save the output to a file in the directory "images" (this directory will be
created if it doesn't exist). The plot is only saved when the grahic window is
closed.
